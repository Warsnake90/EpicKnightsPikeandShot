 **Purpose**   

This is specifically being made for GCL4 Server, as a result recipes and values will be tailored to the gcl4 server balance.
A separate non-glc4 version will be made after the main version is finished. Message @Warsnake901 or @indeinerwand88 on discord for info.

----------------------------------------------------------------------------

 **Mod Status**

Early development.

-Some items are added, however Most do not have finished textures or recipes.

----------------------------------------------------------------------------

**Requests and ports** 

Only accepting requests if they are good and align with my vision

In the far future, It may be ported to 1.12.2 or fabric 1.20.1, However that is not planned as of now.

----------------------------------------------------------------------------

**Foot notes**

Until the mod is in a more playable state, if you wish to get a version of the .jar, you will have to build it yourself.

You can do anything you want with any assets and code, as you credit this github and do not require payment from the end user.

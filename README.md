This is an indev mod for the GCL4 server. Message #Warsnake901 or @indeinerwand88 for info.

THIS IS NOT FINISHED AND WILL NOT BE FINISHED FOR A BIT OF TIME, DO NOT USE THIS AS OF NOW, IT WILL NOT WORK AS INTENDED!

will add late 1600s to early 1700s weapons and armours to epic knights, Forge 1.20.1.

------------------------------------------------------------------

Recipes and damage values will be tailored to the gcl4 balance, I may release a seperate non glc4 version after. 

Please don't give me requests or "can you port to x version" the answer is no.

As of now if you wish to get a version of the .jar, you have to build it yourself.

You can do anything you want with the source code aslong as you credit this github and are not requiring payment from the end user.
